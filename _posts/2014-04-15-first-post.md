title: Starting a blog on electronics
---
Electronics is an interesting realm, but of the ideas are hard to grasp if you haven't spend hours and hours playing with signals and devices.

In order to catch up in some ideas in hardware engineering, I want to document again the learnings that I do, combined with the learnings that I did on my software and business blog: [thinkingonthinking.com](http://thinkingonthinking.com).

So, the goal of this blog is to find and talk with engineers or hobbyists that build interesting pieces of hardware.

As a first start, I am exploring projects on Github:
