title: Starting a blog on electronics
---
Electronics is an interesting realm, but the ideas are hard to grasp if you haven't spend hours playing with signals and devices.

In order to catch up in some ideas in hardware engineering, I want to document again the learnings that I do, combined with the learnings that I did on my software and business blog: [thinkingonthinking.com](http://thinkingonthinking.com).

So, the goal of this blog is to find and talk with engineers or hobbyists that build interesting pieces of hardware.

Where do you go to find discussions on hacking signals and devices?

Some popular electronic blogs and forums seem to be:

* (Electronics-Engineering-Video blog](http://www.eevblog.com/): This is a popular electronic forum and has video blogs and general discussions.
* [Forum Arduino](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php)
* [DangerousPrototypes](http://dangerousprototypes.com/): This is a blog and forum about open-source hardware
* Another helpful forum seems to be [forum.sparkfun](https://forum.sparkfun.com/)
* And a large vendor of electronic stuff including blogs and forum is [adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/)

But community is important, and getting a feeling for who is doing what is important too. This is where Github kicks in, and I discovered already some nice first makers:

* Sean McIntyre: [boxysean](http://boxysean.com/blog/)
* Michael Matuzak: [at Github](https://github.com/emkay) and [his blog](http://lambdaphant.com/)
* Elijah Insua: [tmpvar](http://blog.tmpvar.com/)
* Zapta: [on github](https://github.com/zapta)
