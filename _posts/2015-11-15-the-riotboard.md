Working with embedded graphics and multimedia requires a powerful process.

This was the main reason I got the [Riotboard](http://riotboard.org/) a while ago. The board has a powerful ARM Cortex A9 core delivered by an i.MX6Solo.

The board boots by default Android from the embedded flash.  It also has two SD Card (micro and normal) slots, so you can customize what to boot.
Once an SD-Card is prepared, you can select the OS to boot with jumpers.

Here are the jumper settings taken from [here](http://www.element14.com/community/servlet/JiveServlet/download/2525-37206-123703-151737/RIoTboard+Boot+Switches.pdf)

To work with the board, you'll need an FTDI serial-to-USB converter.

So far, I did not yet manage to install Linux. Also, I am not sure where/how to start with Android developing.
